<h2><a name="introduction">1. Introduction</a></h2>
<p>All scientific units of the Institute for Environment and Sustainability (IES) of the Joint Research Centre use and produce data. It should be easy to discover, access and trace those datasets that are considered reference for the work within IES and to ascertain who are the responsible parties for their creation (or collection), their maintenance and distribution.
</p>
<p>
Quality-ensured metadata is an important means to reach this goal. This guide concerns Metadata for discovery. Metadata for discovery allows users to find a dataset, based on keywords, free text descriptions and additional information such as spatial and temporal extent. This metadata is highly structured and contains a fixed number of elements so that the data can be systematically searched and found.
</p>
<p>
The Reference Data and Services Initiative (RDSI) is an enterprise of IES to establish an infrastructure and governance rules to ensure optimal access to reference data. For metadata concerning spatial data RDSI is supporting INSPIRE (Infrastructure for Spatial Information in Europe) [<a href="#ref1">1</a>] and, therefore, metadata are expected to be compliant with the INSPIRE Metadata Regulation [<a href="#ref2">2</a>] and the corresponding Guidance Documents [<a href="#ref3">3</a>] and [<a href="#ref4">4</a>]. The metadata will then be collected and available to search using the RDSI Portal.  The initial focus of RDSI is on reference data.  The following instructions are, therefore, focused on the creation of metadata for spatial datasets and spatial data series.  Spatial Data Services will be described in a future stage of the project.
</p>

<h2><a name="guidelines">2. Guidelines for Metadata Creation</a></h2>

<h3><a id="identification" name="identification">2.1</a> Identification of the Resource</h3>
<p>Elements that will help the user recognise the resource.</p>
<h3><a id="resourceTitle" name="resourceTitle">2.1.1</a> Resource Title</h3>
<h4>Metadata element name</h4>
<p>Resource Title</p>
<h4>Why is this element required?</h4>
<p>The title is the most informative element of your metadata record. When done correctly, with one glance the person searching for data understands which dataset he or she has in front of him.
In performing a text search within the RDSI portal, the highest priority will be given to results that find the desired search text in the title.
</p>
<h4>Obligation</h4>
<p>Mandatory</p>
<h4>Occurrence</h4>
<p>One</p>
<h4>Domain</h4>
<p>Free text.</p>
<h4>Guidelines for how to fill in the entry</h4>
<p>
Please spend some time thinking about the title.
</p><p>
It must be concise and to the point. It should not contain unexplained acronyms. We suggest a maximum length of 250 characters.
</p><p>
Please be as close as possible to the original title of the resource, in the sense of the ‘official naming’.
</p><p>
If this data is part of a larger project, you might indicate the Project at the end of the title, separated with a comma. In case of Project names, abbreviations are allowed, as long as the rest of the title follows the guidelines above and the abbreviation is spelled out immediately in the abstract.</p>
</p>
<h4>Examples</h4>
<p>Remotely sensed imagery, a series of individual orthorectified scenes (multispectral), IMAGE 2000</p>
<h4>Other comments</h4>
<p></p>


<h3><a id="resourceAbstract" name="resourceAbstract">2.1.2</a> Resource Abstract</h3>
<h4>Metadata element name</h4>
<p>Resource Abstract</p>
<h4>Why is this element required?</h4>
<p>The abstract provides a clear and concise statement that enables the reader to understand the content of the dataset. 
In performing a text search within the RDSI portal, a high priority will be given to results that find the desired search text in the abstract.
</p>
<h4>Obligation</h4>
<p>Mandatory</p>
<h4>Occurrence</h4>
<p>One</p>
<h4>Domain</h4>
<p>Free text.</p>
<h4>Guidelines for how to fill in the entry</h4>
<p>A succinct description (avoid acronyms, if you use them, explain them) of the dataset to include:
<br>• Brief summary: start with the most important details that summarise your dataset.
<br>• Main attributes: briefly describe the main attributes of your dataset.
<br>• Data sources: List the data sources, focus on the responsible parties. 
<br>• Legal references: List the legal references of your data. 
<br>• Importance of the work:  List the impoarnca eof this work, in which other projects is it used? 
<br>• Coverage: A linguistic transcriptions of the extent or location in addition to the bounding box.
<br>
NOTE: Many discovery clients represent as a first preview only the first 100 characters or the first sentence of the abstract. Therefore, please summarise the most important details you would like to communicate in this first sentence.
<h4>Examples</h4>
<p>This data set contains the location of over 4000 Pan European airports and heliports and the most important runways, taken from different sources. 
</p><p>
All the airports and heliports reported by Eurocontrol and those covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1358/2003 and related acts (Commission Regulation (EC) No 158/2007, Commission Regulation (EC) No 546/2005) (http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2003:194:0009:0033:EN:PDF) are depicted as points. The large airports are also depicted as areas (polygons) and include all – except one – of the airports covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1358/2003 (and related acts). The most important runways are depicted as polylines. There is also an additional layer including all the heliports available in the EuroRegionalMap v.3.0 from Eurogeographics. Airports can be identified via different codes (including TEN, IATA ICAO airport codes and the codes reported in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1358/2003 and amendments).
</p><p>
Dataset coverage is geographic Europe plus territories outside Europe administrated by Member States of the European Union.

<h3><a id="resourceType" name="resourceType">2.1.3.</a> Resource Type</h3>
<h4>Metadata element name</h4>
<p>Resource Type</p>

<h4>Why is this element required?</h4>
<p>This choice will be the first you make: depending on the resource type you will be asked to fill different elements.</p>
<p>Classification of the resource based on its scope is important as a user searching for data should easily be able to tell if a resource found is a dataset or data series. </p>

<h4>Obligation</h4>
<p>Mandatory</p>

<h4>Occurrence</h4>
<p>One</p>

<h4>Domain</h4>
<p>Code list provided by ISO 19115 MD_ScopeCode. Those used for RDSI datasets and data series: 
<br>• dataset
<br>• series
</p>

<h4>Guidelines for how to fill in the entry</h4>
<p>Enter the Resource Type that fits the data. A dataset is an identifiable collection of data [ISO 19115], while a data series is a collection of related datasets that share the same product specification [ISO 19115]. The contained datasets can usually be accessed separately. </p>
<p>For example, the IMAGE 2000 series of individual orthorectified scenes in national map projection system is considered a data series as the same data has been recorded for different areas (Landsat TM path and rows).  Another example of data series is when the same data has been recorded on a regular basis over time.</p>


<h4>Examples</h4>
<p>dataset</p>

<h3><a id="resourceLocator" name="resourceLocator">2.1.4.</a> Resource Locator</h3>
<h4>Metadata element name</h4>
<p>Resource Locator</p>

<h4>Why is this element required?</h4>
<p>This is the 'navigation section' of your metadata record. From here you can point users to additional information, to the location where the data can be downloaded and to related view services or where additional information about the resource may be provided.</p>
<p>Setting up the correct resource locators is important for the identification of links between the data and services.</p>
<p>Additional to the resource locator we would like to collect the function that the locator has. This allows clients to sort the list of resource locators and provide some additional information. </p>

<h4>Obligation</h4>
<p>Conditional</p>

<h4>Occurrence</h4>
<p>Multiple</p>

<h4>Domain</h4>
<p>The Resource Locator consists of a Linkage and a Function.
<br>Linkage is a URL.
<br>Function is taken from code list provided by ISO 19115 CI_OnLineFunctionCode:
<br>• download
<br>• information
<br>• search
<br>• offlineAccess
<br>• order
</p>

<h4>Guidelines for how to fill in the entry</h4>
<p>NOTE   The list provided by ISO 19115 is fixed, it does not allow adding terms or changing them. Therefore we provided a mapping from the most frequent types of resource locators to the given list: 
<br>A link to a web page with additional information about the resource should have a Function of 'information'.
<br>If it is possible to download the resource data then links for how to do this must be provided. These links should have a Function of 'download' and could be any of the following:
<br>• A direct download link that returns the actual data.
<br>• A link to a download service i.e. to the GetCapabilities document that provides all the details of an existing service from which the data can be obtained (the form of the link is not important; it could be a GetCapabilities request or point to a XML file within a directory available on the web.  The only requirement is that the link returns the service capabilities XML file).
<br>• A link to a web page from where data can be requested i.e. you have to register as a member and can then make a written request for the data.
<br>
<br>If it is possible to view the resource data then links for how to do this must be provided. These links should have a Function of 'order' and could be any of the following:
<br>• A view client application link that allows users to see the different map layers created from the resource data.
<br>• A link to a view service i.e. to a GetCapabilities document that provides all the details of an existing web map service from which maps created  from the resource can be obtained (again the form of this URL is not important but the link must return the service capabilities XML file).
<br>
<br>For a data series, if it is possible to search for the contained datasets that make up the series then links for how to do this must be provided. These links should have a Function of 'search' and could be any of the following:
<br>• A discovery client application link that allows users to search for the datasets.
<br>• A link to a discovery service i.e. to a GetCapabilities document that provides all the details of a discovery service from which metadata for the datasets can be obtained.
</p>

<h4>Examples</h4>
<p>Additional information on the resource: 
<br>• Linkage - http://image2000.jrc.ec.europa.eu
<br>• Function - information
<br>
<br>View service related to the resource:
<br>• Linkage - http://ags-sdi-public.jrc.ec.europa.eu/arcgis/services/img2k_321_mos/Mapserver/WMSServer?request=GetCapabilities&service=wms&version=1.3.0
<br>• Function - order
<br>
<br>View application related to the resource:
<br>• Linkage - http://floods.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ongoing-floods.html
<br>• Function - order
<br>
<br>Download link for the resource:
<br>• Linkage - http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/corine-land-cover-2000-raster-1
<br>• Function - download
<br>
<br>Search link for the resource:
<br>• Linkage - http://cidportal.jrc.ec.europa.eu/imagearchive/main/ 
<br>• Function - search
</p>

<h4>Other comments</h4>
<p>Please note that Function is an additional element for RDSI, it is not part of the required INSPIRE Metadata.  If the Metadata Editor that you are using does not support this element then leave it out.</p>


<h3><a id="parentIdentifier" name="parentIdentifier">2.1.5.</a> Parent Identifier</h3>
<h4>Metadata element name</h4>
<p>Parent Identifier</p>

<h4>Why is this element required?</h4>
<p>If you create a metadata record for a dataset that is part of a series, then the metadata record of the dataset should point to the metadata record of the series to state 'this is the series I am part of' or in other words, the dataset (child) has to point to the series (parent). This can be done through the element Parent Identifier, which is not an INSPIRE element, but helps enormously when dealing with datasets and data series. </p>
<p>Imagine the following situation: </p>
<p>In a catalogue there is a Metadata Record for a series of datasets IMAGE2000 series of individual orthorectified scenes - multispectral. In the same catalogue there is also a metadata record for each of the more than 400 single images. Currently the catalogue providers are hiding the 400 metadata records describing the images. The reason is simple: Imagine you search for Orthoimagery, and you get back more than 400 results! The records on Image 2000 clutter up the results page and you will not be able to find the information you were really looking for, e.g. the Image 2000 Mosaic, which the catalogue also contains a metadata record for. </p>
<p>If in the future the children could point to their parent, i.e. the Metadata records for datasets could point to the corresponding series, a catalogue client would be able to display the results in a hierarchic manner: First it displays only the data series, and only on request does it display also the metadata records for datasets that are contained in this series.</p>

<h4>Obligation</h4>
<p>Conditional</p>

<h4>Occurrence</h4>
<p>Multiple</p>

<h4>Domain</h4>
<p>Free text</p>

<h4>Guidelines for how to fill in the entry</h4>
<p>Enter the file identifier of the metadata to which this metadata is a subset.</p>

<h4>Examples</h4>
<p>Data series metadata:
<br>• Title - IMAGE2000 series of individual orthorectified scenes - multispectral
<br>• File Identifier - Image2000_Dataseries_MS.xml
<br>
<br>Dataset metadata for a subset of the same resource (i.e. only for the SE2 area of the Image 2000 series):
<br>• Title - IMAGE2000 Product 1 (SE2) multispectral
<br>• Parent Identifier - Image2000_Dataseries_MS.xml
</p>

<h4>Other comments</h4>
<p>Please note that Parent Identifier is an additional element, it is not part of the required INSPIRE Metadata.</p>
<p>This only works if the parent metadata records (i.e. the data series) have unique file identifiers that do not change (see section 2.9.3 File Identifier).</p>

<h3><a id="resourceIdentifier" name="resourceIdentifier">2.1.6.</a> Unique Resource Identifier</h3>
<h4>Metadata element name</h4>
<p>Unique Resource Identifier</p>

<h4>Why is this element required?</h4>
<p>What is a URI? It is very important to have a value that can uniquely identify reference data. This is done through the Unique Resource Identifier (URI), a value that only exists once, like your Codice Fiscale. This value should not change, as long as the reference data it identifies exists. Only a new version of a dataset with its own identity might get a new identifier (for example IMAGE 2000 and IMAGE 2006). </p>
<p>We distinguish between locally unique and globally unique identifiers. </p>
<p>Is it a URL? No, a URI is often confused with a URL: But while a URL stands for Location (usually a location in the internet), URI is only an identifier. It identifies a reference dataset, but it does not necessarily tell you anything about where to find it. </p>
<p>But if it doesn't even tell me where something is, what is it good for? The URI can be used to relate to a resource. For example, when the URI is written in a metadata record, then this is meant to say that this record describes a particular dataset. Titles can change (they might be shortened, spelling might differ etc.), and locations where the reference data is kept might change as well, but the unique resource identifier will remain the same. For this reason the URI is also used to determine relationships between reference data and the services that allow a user to view or to download the reference data. To list all the reference data it provides access to the service will use the URI of the reference data.</p>
<p>Do I need a different URI for my local copy of reference data? No. The URI describes the resource, not a copy of it. The URI can be best compared to an ISBN of a book: Even if there are multiple copies, they all refer to the same resource, and they all have the same ISBN. Only if I modify the copy, and redistribute this modified copy to others, then I might need to register a new reference dataset which gets a new URI. However, these kinds of practices are described in a different document.</p>
<p>Can the same resource have multiple URIs? Yes. The existence of multiple identifiers is a fact of life. For a example, a person can have multiple tax identification numbers in different countries (e.g. a German tax identification number in Germany, and a Codice Fiscale in Italy), each of which can be used to uniquely identify him. </p>
<p>What is the difference between this URI and the File Identifier of the metadata record? The URI describes the dataset or data series while the File Identifier describes the Metadata record. </p>

<h4>Obligation</h4>
<p>Mandatory</p>

<h4>Occurrence</h4>
<p>Multiple</p>

<h4>Domain</h4>
<p>The Unique Resource Identifier consists of a Code and Code Space.
<br>
Code is free text.
<br>
Code Space is free text.
</p>

<h4>Guidelines for how to fill in the entry</h4>
<p>There are two options to generating a Unique Resource Identifier:
<br>1.	Randomly using a generated Universally Unique Identifier (UUID)
<br>2.	Informatively using a well-designed ordered structure
<br>For the random approach the generated UUID is stored as the Code.
<br>We recommend the informative approach. In this approach the Code Space is used to identify the set of Codes.  The Code itself is the unique identifier used by your unit.
<br>For the Code Space we recommend using JRC as a prefix in combination with the numeric identifier for your unit.  This will be the same for each metadata record created by your unit.  Having a code space ensures that no two units will have the same URI.
<br>The Code values need to be designed in a structure that can be added to and will not have to change when new data becomes available, such as:
<br>• Project Name
<br>• Project Version
<br>• Dataset or DataSeries
<br>
• Series Element (time or area etc.) 
</p>

<h4>Examples</h4>
<p>Random Approach Example:
<br>Code : 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
<br>Informative Approach Examples:
<br>
<br>Data - The SDI Unit Image 2000 Multispectral Data Series :
<br>• Code Space: JRC-H06
<br>• Code : Image2000_MS_DataSeries
<br>
<br>Data - The SDI Unit Image 2000 Panchromatic Data Series :
<br>• Code Space : JRC-H06
<br>• Code : Image2000_PAN_DataSeries 
<br>
<br>Data - The SDI Unit Image 2000 Multispectral Dataset for Landsat TM Frame NL5 :
<br>• Code Space : JRC-H06
<br>• Code : Image2000_MS_Dataset_NL5 
<br>
<br>Data - The SDI Unit Image 2000 Multispectral Dataset for Landsat TM Frame GR1 :
<br>• Code Space : JRC-H06
<br>• Code : Image2000_MS_Dataset_GR1
</p>

<h4>Other comments</h4>
<p>A random code can be generated e.g. using the RDSI Metadata editor, available from http://rdsi-portal.jrc.it:8081/rdsi-metadata-editor. </p>
<p>In INSPIRE@EC this is a code in UUID form, generated by the system.</p>

<h3><a id="keywordValue" name="keywordValue">2.2.2.</a> Keyword Value</h3>
<h4>Metadata element name</h4>
<p>Keyword Value</p>

<h4>Why is this element required?</h4>
<p>Highlight the general subject area of the content of the data resource. Like in a library, they allow the metadata creator to tag data and the user to find the data based on these tags. This element is similar to Topic Category but the Keyword Value is not fixed to a high-level code list provided by ISO, instead metadata creators are free to enter more appropriate terms to describe the data resource.</p>

<h4>Guidelines for how to fill in the entry</h4>
<p>
Ideally we should all use the same terms when tagging our data. In this way we prevent problems related to synonyms, antonyms, different spellings etc. For this reason we strongly recommend to only select Keyword Values from a collection of terms, linked and predefined: the General Multilingual Environmental Thesaurus (GEMET) of the European Environment Information and Observation Network (EIONET).
<br>From GEMET, to be INSPIRE compliant, at least one of the INSPIRE Spatial Data Themes must be selected as a keyword. This selection should be done by a group of experts for each category coordinated by the relevant thematic unit. The INSPIRE Spatial Data themes can be browsed in GEMET at:   
<br>http://www.eionet.europa.eu/gemet/inspire_themes?langcode=en 
<br>For your convenience we list all themes here in alphabetical order:
<br>• Addresses
<br>• Administrative units
<br>• Agricultural and aquaculture facilities
<br>• Area management/restriction/regulation zones and reporting units
<br>• Atmospheric conditions
<br>• Bio-geographical regions
<br>• Buildings

<h3><a id="vocabulary" name="vocabulary">2.2.3</a> Originating Controlled Vocabulary</h3>
<h4>Metadata element name</h4>
<p>Originating Controlled Vocabulary</p>

<h4>Why is this element required?</h4>
<p>If keyword Values originate from a controlled vocabulary (like GEMET) then details about that vocabulary are required. 
</p>
<p>Knowing the controlled vocabulary allows users to fully understand the context of the keyword, as the controlled vocabulary often also provides a definition of the term. If, like in case of GEMET, the controlled vocabulary is a multilingual thesaurus, then it is even possible to request a translation of the keyword. Also, as definitions might change, it is important to add which version of the thesaurus the keyword was taken from.
</p>


<h4>Obligation</h4>
<p>Conditional</p>

<h4>Occurrence</h4>
<p>None or one for each keyword but many keywords can belong to one Originating Controlled Vocabulary</p>

<br>Title is free text.
<br>Date Type is taken from a code list provided by ISO 19115 CI_DateTypeCode:
<br>• creation
<br>• publication
<br>• revision
<br>Date is a valid date.  
</p>

<h4>Guidelines for how to fill in the entry</h4>
<p>As at least one of the INSPIRE Spatial Data Themes must be selected as a keyword and we strongly recommend using only the GEMET Concept list for other keywords, examples for these are provided below.</p>

<h4>Guidelines for how to fill in the entry</h4>
<p>To help you find the co-ordinates for your data resource we have produced a list of the bounding-boxes for all European countries.  See Appendix II for details of this list and an explanation on where it came from.</p>
<p>If the data Geographic Bounding Box for the data resource is within continental Europe then the co-ordinates entered must be based on the European Terrestrial Reference System 1989 (ETRS89) and provided in decimal degrees with precision of at least 2 decimals.  Outside continental Europe co-ordinates based on any geodetic coordinate reference system with the Greenwich Prime Meridian (such as the World Geodetic System, WGS84) are acceptable. Coordinates should be as well provided in decimal degrees with precision of at least 2 decimals.</p>

<h4>Examples</h4>
<p>
Bounding Box for the UK:
<br>• North Bound Latitude: 60.84
<br>• East Bound Latitude: 1.76
<br>• South Bound Latitude: 49.88

<h3><a id="temporal" name="temporal">2.4</a> Temporal Reference of the Resource</h3>
<p>This allows users to search for data by date.</p>
<p>Individually all temporal reference elements are conditional but one or more temporal reference must be provided.  However, it is important that all metadata records provide this information as complete as possible to aid the performance of a search by date.  At least the creation date or the temporal extent must be provided.</p>
<p>To avoid the confusion of different styles and interpretations of dates, these guidelines fix the date (and time) representation, following ISO 8601 Data elements and interchange formats - Information interchange - Representation.</p>
<p>Thus, we recommend to use the date format YYYY-MM-DD where YYYY is the year in the Gregorian calendar, MM is the month of the year between 01 (January) and 12 (December), and DD is the day of the month between 01 and 31. For the expressions with high precision the date format can extended with the time format hh:mm:ss where hh is the number of complete hours that have passed since midnight, mm is the number of complete minutes since the start of the hour, and ss is the number of complete seconds since the start of the minute. The capital letter T is used to separate the date and time components, which then combines into YYYY-MM-DDT hh:mm:ss. </p>
<p>NOTE 	In case your Metadata editor tool has limitations to express the dates according to these guidelines, they might be temporarily overwritten with different rules. In this case we suggest: If the day and/or month is unknown the 01-01 of that year should be encoded. If no information on the temporal reference is available then insert the year 9999 to indicate that it is unknown. However, please note that this results in false precisions which have to be removed as soon as the tools allow for this </p>

  
<h3><a id="temporalExtent" name="temporalExtent">2.4.1</a> Temporal Extent</h3>
<h4>Metadata element name</h4>
<p>Temporal Extent</p>

<h4>Why is this element required?</h4>
<p>This is the time period covered by the content of the data resource. For certain data such as Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data it is most important to understand for which time period this information is available. Other examples are sensor data for meteorological parameters and model results that provide time series with a certain temporal extent.  </p>

<h4>Obligation</h4>
<p>Conditional</p>

<h4>Occurrence</h4>
<p>One</p>

<h4>Domain</h4>
<p>The Temporal Extent consists of a Start Date and an End Date.
<br>Start Date and End Date are valid dates.
</p>

<h4>Guidelines for how to fill in the entry</h4>
<p>Please do not express false accuracy in the sense of more precision than the data contains. Depending on the precision you want to express, you can leave out elements of the representation, such as: 
<br>• YYYY-MM. To express only the month 
<br>• YYYY. To express only the year
<br>Additionally, we also allow for an indeterminate end date: If, for example, a data series is updated every day with the latest information then the day after you have created your metadata record it will be immediately out of date. For this reason a time period which has an end position of indeterminate value 'now' is valid. 
</p>

<h4>Examples</h4>
<p>Start Date - 2010-01-15
<br>End Date - 2010-12-15
<br>
<br>Start Date - 2010-01-15

<p>The European mosaic is a multi-purpose and multi-scale product. To achieve this, technical specifications were defined to allow implementation of different mosaic types, based on specific user requirements. All bands were re-projected from the national projection systems to a European representation, in full resolution. The image re-projection is based on three sets of parameters: Map projection, Spheroid and Datum (7term Bursa-Wolf or 3 term Molodensky transformation according to the datum definition available for each country). All scenes orthorectified into national projection system were re-projected into geographic coordinates according to the ETRS89 specification (ETRS89 stands for European Terrestrial Reference System 1989). The re-projected pixel size is 0.0002300 deg for the multispectral bands. Re-projection of raster data to geographic coordinates implicates non-square image pixel with variable pixel size, when projected into plain and expressed in meters. </p>

<h3><a id="spatialResolution" name="spatialResolution">2.5.2</a> Spatial Resolution</h3>
<h4>Metadata element name</h4>
<p>Spatial Resolution</p>

<h4>Why is this element required?</h4>
<p>Spatial resolution refers to the level of detail of the spatial data resource. Imagine that a user is interested in finding orthoimagery data with a resolution distance of 25 meters or more. To make this possible this element must be filled in and the information given must be harmonised (otherwise people will enter a unit of measure as many different things i.e. m, meter, metre, km, kilometre, kilometres, etc.).</p>

<h4>Obligation</h4>
<p>Conditional (Mandatory for datasets and dataset series where a resolution distance can be specified)</p>

<h4>Occurrence</h4>
<p>Multiple</p>

<h4>Domain</h4>
<p>The Spatial Resolution consists of an Equivalent Scale or Distance.
<br>Equivalent Scale is an integer. 
<br>Distance is a number with an accompanying unit of measure.
</p>

<h4>Guidelines for how to fill in the entry</h4>
<p>Distance is used typically for gridded data and imagery-derived products and represents the resolution distances.  Equivalent Scale is usually used for maps or map-derived products.</p>
<p>An equivalent scale is generally expressed as an integer value expressing the scale denominator. For example a map with a scale of 1:25.000 gets the value"25000". </p>
<p>To harmonise the unit of measure and to avoid different spellings, please use m for metre and km for kilometre.  </p>

<h3><a id="specification" name="specification">2.6.1</a> Specification</h3>
<h4>Metadata element name</h4>
<p>Specification</p>

<h4>Why is this element required?</h4>
<p>This element contains information on the known legislation (or specifications) against which the resource is evaluated including a date of reference to that legislation.  </p>
<p>This is important if you provide your data in compliance with a specific data model or in the context of a particular legislation. For example, if you provide your data according to the INSPIRE data specifications, which means they follow a particular well-known data model.</p>

<h4>Domain</h4>
<p>The Specification consists of a Title, Address, Reference Date Type and Reference Date.
<br>Title is free text.
<br>Address is a URL (optional or recommended).
<br>Reference Date Type is taken from a code list provided by ISO 19115 CI_DateTypeCode:
<br>• creation
<br>• publication
<br>• revision
<br>Reference Date is a valid date.  
</p>

<h4>Guidelines for how to fill in the entry</h4>
<p>For legislation that can be found in Eur-lex, the title should be the same as found there.  </p>
<p>We recommend that all metadata contains the INSPIRE legislation. Resources categorised under Annex I of the INSPIRE Directive may or may not currently be conformant to this legislation but this can be stated using the Degree element (see below). Even for resources categorised under Annex II or III of the INSPIRE Directive (to which the INSPIRE legislation does not yet apply) we would still like this included and for now marked as not conformant and then amended when the INSPIRE legislation gets updated.</p>
<p>For INSPIRE data specifications use the title of the guidelines document as found on the INSPIRE website at http://inspire.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.cfm. Please be aware that for Annex II and III resources the documents are still in the draft stage (see Consultations tab - Consultation on the draft legal act on the harmonization and interoperability of environmental information (as defined in Annexes II and III of the INSPIRE Directive (2/2007))).</p>
<p>The legislation and data specifications do not only imply to INSPIRE, there could be other standards relating particularly to that type of data resource.  For example river basin management data may well be evaluated against the EU Water Framework Directive.</p>
<p>Reference Date may be any degree of precision from century (YY) to full date (YYYY-MM-DD).</p>

<p>Note that this element describes the reasons for the limitations on public access. The limitations themselves, if any, should be listed under Conditions Applying to Access and Use.</p>

<h4>Obligation</h4>
<p>Mandatory</p>

<h4>Occurrence</h4>
<p>Multiple</p>

<h4>Domain</h4>
<p>Code list provided by the INSPIRE Directive which describes the way in which public access may be limited:
<br>• no limitation
<br>• (a) the confidentiality of the proceedings of public authorities, where such confidentiality is provided for by law
<br>• (b) international relations, public security or national defence
<br>• (c) the course of justice, the ability of any person to receive a fair trial or the ability of a public authority to conduct an enquiry of a criminal or disciplinary nature
<br>• (d) the confidentiality of commercial or industrial information, where such confidentiality is provided for by national or Community law to protect a legitimate economic interest, including the public interest in maintaining statistical confidentiality and tax secrecy
<br>• (e) intellectual property rights
<br>• (f) the confidentiality of personal data and/or files relating to a natural person where that person has not consented to the disclosure of the information to the public, where such confidentiality is provided for by national or Community law
<br>• (g) the interests or protection of any person who supplied the information requested on a voluntary basis without being under, or capable of being put under, a legal obligation to do so, unless that person has consented to the release of the information concerned
<br>• (h) the protection of the environment to which such information relates, such as the location of rare species
</p>

<h4>Guidelines for how to fill in the entry</h4>
<p>Enter the limitation on public access that fits the data.
<br>If there is no limitation on public access, then you have to choose the entry 'no limitation'.
</p>

<h4>Examples</h4>
<p>Your data is not accessible to the general public because your data has underlying licensing restrictions, enter (e) intellectual property rights.</p>

<h3><a id="organization" name="organization">2.8</a> Responsibility for the Resource</h3>
<p>Details of the organisation(s) responsible for the establishment, maintenance and distribution of the resource including how they can be contacted.</p>
  
<h3><a id="party" name="party">2.8.1</a> Responsible Party</h3>
<h4>Metadata element name</h4>
<p>Responsible Party</p>

<h4>Why is this element required?</h4>
<p>If users have any questions relating to the resource found they need information on who to contact and how they can be contacted.</p>
<p>Searching via this field allows users to immediately look for or filter data available from JRC, from EEA or from EUROSTAT. Thus, being restrictive on the names to be used allows us to be much more effective when performing a search.</p>

<h4>Obligation</h4>
<p>Mandatory</p>

<h4>Occurrence</h4>
<p>Multiple</p>

<h4>Domain</h4>
<p>The Responsible Party consists of an Organisation Name and an Email Address.
<br>Organisation Name is free text.
<br>Email Address must be of valid email format.
</p>

<h4>Guidelines for how to fill in the entry</h4>
<p>Fill in each of the organisations responsible for the resource. 
<br>The name of the organisation should be given in full, without abbreviations. These names should come from a common codelist to be agreed for all DGs. 
<br>For the email we suggest avoiding personal emails as people come and go.  Instead use regularly checked functional mail boxes of the unit or project responsible for the resource. This will be for your convenience, as you do not have to update your metadata if a person leaves.
</p>

<h4>Examples</h4>
<p>Organisation Name - European Commission, Joint Research Centre
<br>E-Mail Address - rdsi-team@jrc.ec.europa.eu 
</p>

<h4>Other comments</h4>
<p>The restriction on the affiliation of European Commission, Joint Research Centre instead of units or actions was a recommendation from the Unit head consultation carried out in the context of IES in May 2011.</p>
  
<h3><a id="role" name="role">2.8.2</a> Responsible Party Role</h3>
<h4>Metadata element name</h4>
<p>Responsible Party Role</p>

<h4>Why is this element required?</h4>
<p>Responsible parties may have different roles.  They might be the owner, the producer or the creator of the resource. Therefore, in particular if more than one Responsible Party is named, the Responsible Party Role allows users to direct questions to the correct person or functional email box.</p>

<h4>Obligation</h4>
<p>Mandatory</p>

<h4>Occurrence</h4>
<p>One for each responsible party</p>

<h4>Domain</h4>
<p>Code list provided by ISO 19115 CI_RoleCode:
<br>• resourceProvider
<br>• custodian
<br>• owner
<br>• user
<br>• distributor
<br>• originator
<br>• pointOfContact
<br>• principalInvestigator
<br>• processor
<br>• publisher
<br>• author
<br>See Appendix III for a brief description of each Responsible Party Role.
</p>

<h4>Guidelines for how to fill in the entry</h4>
<p>Select all role that best represents the function performed by the responsible party.
<br>We recommend that you provide at least the Point of Contact of the resource.
</p>

<h4>Examples</h4>
<p>pointOfContact</p>

<h3><a id="metadata" name="metadata">2.9</a> Details about the Metadata Record</h3>
<p>Having details about the metadata record is important because it allows users to evaluate and feedback on the metadata they find.</p>
  
<h3><a id="contact" name="contact">2.9.1</a> Point of Contact</h3>
<h4>Metadata element name</h4>
<p>Point of Contact</p>

<h4>Why is this element required?</h4>
<p>The responsible party for the creation and maintenance of the metadata is not necessarily the same as the responsible party of the data. On the contrary, quite often the creation of metadata is outsourced. Therefore, if a user has questions or concerns about a metadata record, he/she needs to know who to contact.</p>

<h4>Obligation</h4>
<p>Mandatory</p>

<h4>Occurrence</h4>
<p>Multiple</p>

<h4>Domain</h4>
<p>The Point of Contact consists of an Organisation Name and an Email Address.
<br>Organisation Name is free text.
<br>Email Address must be of valid email format.
</p>

<h4>Guidelines for how to fill in the entry</h4>
<p>The name of the organisation should be given in full, without abbreviations. These names should come from a common codelist to be agreed for all DGs. </p>
<p>For the email we suggest avoiding personal emails as people come and go.  Instead use regularly checked functional mail boxes of the unit or project responsible for the resource. This will be for your convenience, as you do not have to update your metadata if a person leaves.</p>
<p>Remember this refers to the metadata record and not the resource.  The Point of Contact is responsible for questions regarding the metadata, not the resource.</p>

<h4>Examples</h4>
<p>Organisation Name - European Commission, Joint Research Centre
<br>E-Mail Address - rdsi-team@jrc.ec.europa.eu

<h3><a id="metadata_date" name="metadata_date">2.9.2</a> Metadata Date</h3>
<h4>Metadata element name</h4>
<p>Metadata Date</p>

<h4>Why is this element required?</h4>
<p>Metadata should be of quality, it should be clear on which date the metadata was created or when it was last updated.</p>

<h4>Obligation</h4>
<p>Mandatory</p>

<h4>Occurrence</h4>
<p>One</p>

<h4>Domain</h4>
<p>Valid date</p>

<h4>Guidelines for how to fill in the entry</h4>
<p>We suggest the full date (YYYY-MM-DD) as anything else lacks accuracy.</p>

<h4>Examples</h4>
<p>2010-05-11</p>

<h4>Other comments</h4>

<h3><a id="metadata_language" name="metadata_language">2.9.3</a> Metadata Language</h3>
<h4>Metadata element name</h4>
<p>Metadata Language</p>

<h4>Why is this element required?</h4>
<p>Metadata should be of quality, it should be clear which language used for documenting the metadata.</p>

<h4>Obligation</h4>
<p>Mandatory</p>

<h4>Occurrence</h4>
<p>One</p>

<h4>Domain</h4>
<p>Code list provided by ISO 639-2 which describes each language in three-letter tags.
<br>Some commonly used values are: 
<br>• eng - English 
<br>• dut - Dutch 
<br>• fre - French 
<br>• ger - German 
<br>• gre - Greek 
<br>• ita - Italian 
<br>• spa - Spanish
<br>You find the complete list of all codes in Appendix IV of this document.

<h3><a id="file_identifier" name="file_identifier">2.9.4</a> File Identifier</h3>
<h4>Metadata element name</h4>
<p>File Identifier</p>

<h4>Why is this element required?</h4>
<p>What is a File Identifier? A value that can identify the metadata record.</p>
<p>What is the difference between the File identifier and the Unique Resource Identifier of the resource? The URI describes the dataset or data series while the File Identifier describes the Metadata record.</p>
<p>This element must be included for a data series if you require that datasets (children) point to the data series (parent).  See 2.1.5 Parent Identifier for a more detailed explanation.</p>

<h4>Obligation</h4>
<p>Conditional 
<br>(Mandatory for a data series to be linked with its child datasets)
</p>

<h4>Occurrence</h4>
<p>One</p>

<h4>Domain</h4>
<p>Free text</p>

<h4>Guidelines for how to fill in the entry</h4>
<p>Parent metadata records (i.e. the data series) should have a unique file identifier that does not change.</p>
<p>Do not change this File Identifier even if you update the metadata.</p>

<h4>Examples</h4>
<p>File Identifier - Image2000_Dataseries_MS.xml</p>

<h4>Other comments</h4>
<p>Please note that File Identifier is an additional RDSI element, it is not part of the required INSPIRE Metadata. </p>

<h3><a name="appendixii">Appendix II:</a> Geographic Bounding Boxes</h3>
<p>The original data used to extract the bounding boxes was taken from the shapefile of Countries 2006 downloaded from the GISCO database available at:</p>
<p>http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/gisco_Geographical_information_maps/popups/references/administrative_units_statistical_units_1</p>
<p>For the European outermost regions the co-ordinate reference system of the shapefiles has been transformed from ETRS89 (EPSG:4258) to WGS84 (EPSG:4326).</p>
<p>The Bounding Boxes for Portugal, Spain and France also include some of the Europe Outermost Regions (Azores and Madeira, Canary Islands, French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique and R&eacute;union, Saint Barth&eacute;lemy and Saint Martin). In these cases a 'Continental' Bounding Box was also created that excludes the outermost region.</p>
